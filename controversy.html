              The main role of the owner of a sports team is to hire the right people for front office roles, approve contracts and spend money.
              The primary role of General Manger is to trade, acquire, and find players and management. The GM is largely responsible for
              how well the team plays and operates, and will either get an extension or fired depending on the results. Moreover,
              The Manager of a baseball team is in charge of the day to day operations of the ball club. They
              create the lineups, strategies and make in game decisions.
              <p>Below are examples of the Wilpons getting "too" involved in baseball operations:</p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Jeff Wilpon did not dispute that he is in charge of day to day operations when asked.</li>
                  <li>Executives say the GM lacks autonomy and worn down by the Wilpons’ penchant for micromanaging via voluminous phone calls
                     and meetings.</li>
                  <li>Jeff Wilpon forced injured Mets ace pitcher Pedro Martinez to start a meaningless game at the end of the 2005 season to sell more tickets. Wilpon allegedly said to Martinez "While I’m the boss here, you’re going to have to do what I say".</li>
                  <li>In 2005, Wilpon forced GM Omar Minaya to fire then Manager Willie Randolph at 3am eastern time while the team was in Los Angeles.</li>
                  <li>Peter Gammons, a sports media personality, said in 2009 that Jeff Wilpon is the real GM of the Mets, not Omar Minaya. Minaya is just there to take the heat.</li>
                  <li>Jeff Wilpon's reputation in the industry is that he is short tempered, tone deaf, a credit seeker, an accountability deflector, a micro manager, and bad at self awareness.</li>

            In 2017 the Mets were spent $155 million on players, about $40 million less than the luxory tax.The New York Yankees, who play in the same city, spent $200 million that season. Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said that the Mets were "over budget." The Mets
            are worth $2.6 billion, the 6th most valuable team in the MLB, behind the Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox, Cubs and Giants. The Mets play in New York City, are one of the most valuable teams and should be sepnding money like one, but the Wilpon's will not allow it.

                    <p class="contract card-text">After the Detroit Tigers traded Cespedes to the Mets in the middle of 2015, he carried the team into the postseason, hitting .287 with 17 homeruns in just 57 games. After having a productive and relatively healthy 2016, he signed a 4 year $110 million contract to return.
                    Cespedes has appeeared in 119 games since 2017, largely due to having surgery on both heels that caused him to be out for 8-10 months. While rehabbing a year after the surgery, Cespedes fractured his ankle on his ranch after getting "attacked" by a wild boar and stepping in a hole. Cespedes missed the entire 2019 season and may not even play in 2020.</p>

The Pirates traded Bay to the Red Sox and he responded by hitting 36 homeruns, 119 RBI's, playing in the All Star Game and finishing 7th in MVP voting.
                    The Mets signed Bay in the midst of his prime and thought they were getting one of the best and most reliable players in the MLB. In his 3 years with the Mets, Bay played in a just over 50% of the teams games, hit .234 with 26 homeruns and was released in 2012. He joins a long list of dissapointing players for a dissapointing franchise.  </p>

                    <p class="contract card-text">At the end of 2018, the Mets traded with the Mariners for Hall of Famer Robinson Cano and Star Closer Edwin Diaz while giving up top prospect Jarred Kelenic among others. The Mets were in the process of a rebuild and desperately needed a closer, but Seattle did not want to give up Diaz without getting rid of the expensive contract of the aging Cano.
                    After several productive and healthy seasons with the Mariners, Cano was constantly injured, playing in 107 games. He also only hit .256, the lowest batting average of his career, to go with 13 homeruns and 39 RBIs, another career low. Diaz, who had a 1.96 ERA with 57 saves in 2018, pitched to the tune of 5.59 ERA and 26 saves and became a weakness in the Mets already infamously bad bullpen. </p>
