          <p class="font">The New York Mets were established in 1962, when the Brookyln Dodgers
          and New York Giants left for the West Coast in 1957. This departure left the great city of New York with only
        one team, the New York Yankees. Several years later, the New York Mets came into existence, combining the blue of the Dodgers
      and the orange of the Giants to create the world famous colors we know and love today. </p>

          <p class="font">In their 7 year history, the Amazin's never had a winning season,
            until 1969 when they went an unprecedented 100-62 en route to winning the World Series. After years of finishing amongst the worst teams in baseball, the Mets finally
            reached the pinnacle all baseball players dream of. Lead by Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Tom Seaver, as well as Mets legends, Jerry Koosman, Ed Cranepool, Cleon Jones, and Donn Clendenon;
            the Mets became the first expansion team to make the postseason, the first to win a postseason series, and the first to win the World Series.  </p>

            <p class="font">In 1986 the Mets finished with a franchise best 108-54 record and overcame a 3-2 deficit against the Boston Red Sox in one of the most iconic World Series' of all time.
           After making a comeback in the bottom of the 9th innning, the Mets found themselves down 2 runs heading into the 10th.
          They were quickly down to their last out, but would not give up. After miraculously tying the game up on a wild pitch, the Mets would go on to
        win the game after Mookie Wilson hit a slow ground ball that went through the legs of Bill Buckner. What preceded, was one of the most amazing moments in MLB history, sending Shea stadium into a frenzy. The Mets would go on
      to win the World Series and capture their second championship in franchise history.   </p>

        <h3 class="head">2001 - Mike Piazza's 9/11 Homerun</h3>
          <p class="font">A year after losing to the New York Yankees in the World Series, the Mets finished 82-80 and missed the postseason.
            After the September 11th attacks, the city of New York was devesated, heartbroken and demoralized. 10 days later the Mets faced their bitter rivals, the Atlanta Braves, in what would be the
            first game played in New York since this horrifc event. The city was in desperate need of a small dose of healing, and New York Mets Hall of Famer, Mike Piazza, delivered. As the Mets were making a playoff push down
            2-1 in the bottom of the 8th, Piazza hit a go ahead two-run homerun, leading the Mets to victory. Piazza's iconic homerun provided a moment of normalcy and smiles in a time where it was anything but, cementing it as one of the greatest moments in Mets and MLB history.

          <h3 class="head">2015 - A Run for the Ages</h3>
            <p class="font">After years of embrassment and underperforming, it looked as though the Mets finally figured things out.
            After acquiring superstar Yoenis Cespedes over the summer, the Amazin's went on an unbelievable run to finish out the season. They made the postseason and faced the LA Dodgers in the NLDS.
          Carried by Daniel Murphy, the best rotation in the MLB and hungry for revenge after Chase Utley's dirty slide that wound up derailing Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada's career, they defeated the Dodgers in 5 games, and swept the Chicago Cubs in the following series.
        The Mets were red hot and made their first World Series in 15 years, facing the Kansas City Royals. Unfortunately, mistakes cost the Mets as they blew the lead in the 8th inning and beyond 3 times and ultimately lost the World Series in 5 games. This was one of the most heartbreaking moments in frachise history,
        as the Mets should have won the series in 5 games if not for blunders in Game 1, 4 and 5.  </p>
